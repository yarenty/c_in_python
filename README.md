# Use C in python


## STEPS

### 0. Install swig

On mac:

```shell
brew install swig
```


### 1. Example C code is in example.c file ;-)

There are few functions and some veriable.

@TODO: Check with classes and more complex structures.


### 2. Creaate interface file *i* - example.i

Few questions waiting answers:

- why there is "%module" what is meaning
- what is between %{} 
- why there is copy what is inside braces also outside it -  without "extern"
